                    <div class="white fw-600 fs-m1  opacity-90"> MANILA – Two members of the House of Representatives on Tuesday pushed for the passage of a bill legalizing marijuana or cannabis for medicinal purposes.
                    
                     During a public hearing, Surigao Del Norte 2nd District Representative Robert "Ace" Barbers, House Committee on Dangerous Drugs chairperson, said that while cannabis may be legalized for medicinal use, House Bill (HB) 6783 does not allow its recreational use.
                    
                     “Recently, more and more countries are easing regulations on the said drug for medicinal purposes. Other countries have already allowed its recreational use. For our purposes, we will limit it for medicinal purposes only,” Barbers said.
                    
                     Former House Speaker and now Davao del Norte Rep. Pantaleon Alvarez authored HB 6783 seeking to remove cannabis from the list of illegal drugs and substances.
                    
                     Alvarez said the classification of cannabis and its derivatives, as a dangerous drug, "makes no sense at all." "And we must correct this absurdity,” he said.
                    
                     Barbers said there is evidence that cannabis oil and other derivatives are helping seriously ill patients.
                    
                     “It is just a matter of time before we are deluged with calls to open our eyes and minds to the latest scientific developments now benefiting humanity,” he said. “If our chemical heavy pharma couldn’t find the cure to these illnesses, why would we stand in the way and deprive the afflicted of relief and enjoyment of their lives.”</div>

                    <div class="white fw-600 fs-m1 opacity-90">According to a study by the RCG Economics and Marijuana Policy Group, should the State of Nevada legalize recreational cannabis, the move will support over 41,000 jobs by 2024 and generate over USD1.7 billion in labor income, he added.

“Let us give cannabis a second chance. Let us make this happen by giving our all-out support for HB 6783, otherwise known as An Act Removing Cannabis and any Form of Derivative Thereof from the List of Dangerous Drugs and Substances Under Existing Laws’,” he said. (PNA
