Sen.

MANILA, Philippines — Blindsided again by a student’s death from fraternity hazing, senators on Tuesday floated the idea of expanding the scope of the Anti-Hazing Act to penalize fraternity officers and alumni who are aware of — but not necessarily witness to — the initiation rites carried out against new members.

Sen. Raffy Tulfo, who led lawmakers in grilling resource speakers in the legislative inquiry into the death of student John Matthew Salilig, said that amending the Anti-Hazing Act of 2018 to punish fraternity leaders even remotely aware of hazing but refuse to report to authorities would be a “deterrent” to deadly initiation rites.

“An initiation will not take place without the permission of the heads of a fraternity. So therefore, if hazing will take place, all officers should be automatically charged with reclusion perpetua,” Tulfo said in Filipino.

The Anti-Hazing Act was just revised in 2018 to outright ban hazing and impose stiffer penalties on persons involved in carrying out violent initiation rites.
